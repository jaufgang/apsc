# APSC Bulletin Board

The online bulletin board for Aquatic Park Sailing Club members.

---

## What is this?

A simple web app for APSC members to:
- Sign up for volunteer shifts (Duty Officer, Shuttle Driver, events)
- Track work obligation hours
- Post classifieds, find crew, share announcements
- View their membership info and mooring details
- Submit annual insurance documents

Plus a **public sign-in sheet** for reciprocal visitors to book their stay (no login required).

Think of it as the clubhouse bulletin board - just online.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
- **Data**: Grist (club's existing membership database)
- **Auth**: TBD (Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth)
- **Hosting**: TBD (Vercel, Netlify, or similar)

See [TECHNICAL.md](./TECHNICAL.md) for details.

## Current Priority

**Job Board** is the first feature being built. It solves the most immediate pain point - tracking volunteer work obligations.

## Getting Started (Dev)

*Coming soon - project setup instructions will go here once we start implementation.*

For now, see [TECHNICAL.md](./TECHNICAL.md) for environment setup notes.
